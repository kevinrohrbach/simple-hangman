## What is this?
A simple hangman game coded in Python 3.9.1 based on the project on www.data-flair.com as part of my continuing training in Python.

I made a couple of changes to the original project
- Changed the source of the word to an online word list, from which one random one is chosen, using requests
- Added functionality to find multiple occurrences of letter in word
- Slightly changed hangman animation and added 1 guess to the limit
